# Python header generator

In this project I am working on a header generator for python programs. The python script already works. I'm still working on a graphical user interface. Furthermore, the generated header blocks should be more beautiful ...
## Installation

At this time you don't need any libraries to use the Python script.

## Usage

Just download the main.py file and run it.
You can also implement and test the function from the big_logo.py file in your program. However, the following library is required for this:

```bash
pip install pyfiglet
```
